synopsis: Generate the autocompletion script for zsh
description: |
    Generate the autocompletion script for the zsh shell.

    If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment you will need
    to enable it.  You can execute the following once:

    	echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

    To load completions in your current shell session:

    	source <(health-checker completion zsh)

    To load completions for every new session, execute once:

    #### Linux:

    	health-checker completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_health-checker"

    #### macOS:

    	health-checker completion zsh > $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_health-checker

    You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.
